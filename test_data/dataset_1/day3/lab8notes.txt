lab 8 notes-
don't use anything marked (not good).
part 1: 
- part a: used R1 = 100 kOhm, R2 = 100 kOhm pot (measured value of 44.2 kOhm).
- Vcc+ = 8 V. 
- part b: screenshot: 00. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, Vb = Vcc+. (not good)
- part b: screenshot: 01. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, Vb = Vcc+. (more rampy)
- part c: screenshot: 02. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, noise on (10%), Vb = Vcc+. (not good)
- part c: screenshot: 03. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, modulation 50 kHz, 10% depth, Vb = Vcc+. 
- part c: screenshot: 04. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, modulation 10 kHz, 10% depth, Vb = Vcc+.

part 2:
- part a: used potentiometer of 25kOhm as R3. Vcc = +- 8V.
- part b: screenshot: 00. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, no modulation. f = 1kHz.
- part c: screenshot: 01. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, no modulation. f = 1kHz. Changed R3=22.7 kOhm. used symmetric sawtooth wave.
- part c: screenshot: 02. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, no modulation. f = 1kHz. Changed R3=1.7 kOhm. used symmetric sawtooth wave.
- part c: screenshot: 03. Va = 10 Vpp ramp wave from fn generator, no modulation. f = 1kHz. Changed R3=5.7 kOhm. used symmetric sawtooth wave.
- part d: screenshot: 04. 
- - wave was smaller with modulation, changed R2=10 Ohm, which lowered our reference voltage for the comparator. 

part 3:
- connected temperature sensor to ground with 1kOhm resistor.
- want 313 mV/K from temperature sensor, so R2 = 30 Ohm, R1 = 928.4 Ohm
- - used R2 = 30 Ohm, R1 = 910 Ohm. gives us 319 mV.
- - used R3 = 130 kOhm.
- - V(high) = 317 mV, v(low) = 320.55 mV. saw successful switch.
